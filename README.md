# Vacuumtube Elite Launchers 🚀

> "I use Arch, BTW." - Every Chad Senior Dev ever.

This repository contains the ultimate configuration for the [Vacuumtube](https://github.com/u8sand/vacuumtube) YouTube client. If you're tired of your launcher not finding your favorite electron-based tube client, you've come to the right place. This is the **Senior Developer** way to handle symlinks: **Delete them and use proper XDG Desktop Entries.**

## Features
- **Over 9000** efficiency levels.
- Triple-threat launching: `youtube`, `tube`, or `vacuumtube`.
- Custom-drawn SVG icon (because "no icon" is for juniors).
- Fully tracked via `pacman` (via this PKGBUILD) because we value our system integrity.

## Installation (The Chad Way)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nsomnia/vacuumtube-launchers
cd vacuumtube-launchers
makepkg -si
```

## Manual Reproduction Script
If you want to feel the raw power of the shell without the safety of a package manager:
```bash
chmod +x reproduce_efforts.sh
./reproduce_efforts.sh
```

## Technical Details
- **Architecture**: Any (obviously, it's just scripts and metadata).
- **Skill Level**: Elite / Super Saiyan.
- **Humor**: Included.
